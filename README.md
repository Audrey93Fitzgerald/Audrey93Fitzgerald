## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a front-end developer with a focus on crafting responsive, accessible, and visually appealing web layouts using HTML5, CSS3, and Flexbox. This space is where I share my personal projects, layout experiments, and front-end development practice.

Iâ€™m passionate about turning ideas into clean, functional web interfaces. I enjoy the process of transforming designs into pixel-perfect code while ensuring they look great and perform well across all devices. Whether it's building a landing page, a multi-section layout, or a component-based design system, I always aim to create user-friendly experiences that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.

This repository includes a variety of projects that explore layout techniques, responsive design patterns, and modern front-end best practices. Flexbox has become one of my favorite tools for structuring page contentâ€”it allows for flexibility, control, and clean code that works well across browsers. I also work with media queries, semantic HTML, and scalable CSS to ensure every layout is maintainable and future-proof.

I value code thatâ€™s not only functional but also easy to read and reuse. Each project here reflects that mindset, with simple file structures, consistent naming, and helpful comments to make the code approachable for other developers.

Whether you're here to learn, get inspiration, or collaborate, you're more than welcome to explore what Iâ€™ve built. Iâ€™m always improving and eager to learn more from the web development community.

Thanks for visitingâ€”feel free to fork a project, leave feedback, or just browse around. There's always more to create, refine, and share.
